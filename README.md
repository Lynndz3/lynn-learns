A site to start blogging my learnings using this layout as a guide: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

The header is Lynn Learns with emojis

Add links just for testing for now, but then remove.

Instead of sign-up, direct person to contact me with thoughts

The content will include:
- My posts with learnings
- A list of resources and option for people to vote or add more (ex.  stack overflow)
