    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey there. My name is Lynn. In Sept 2022, I decided to switch careers from Product Management to Software Development.
        Why? 1. passion for the tech, 2. enjoyment from working with software developers. 3. simple curiosity. 
    </p>
    <p>While I can't say exactly where this journey will take me, I'm excited to dive in. I'm excited to learn. 
        And I'm excited to share my experiences coming from the business side.</p>
